# Isomo Recruitment

## Hiring process could be better and we are here to implement some radical improvement

## Why Isomo?
The current recruitment process could be **time consuming** and sometimes contain **unintentional bias**. People can fall prey to collective decision making errors similar to “herd behavior’, social hierarchy bias, and social conformity bias. These above challenges have become obstacles for companies that are striving to create a **diversified environment** through fair recruitment.

## Our Vision
We thrive to achieve **true equality** during the recruitment process by **filtering** out potential information that could lead to biases(e.g. Race, gender) from the applicant. This allows recruiters to simply analyze applications based on skillsets, experience, and performance.

## How did we do it?

Hello this is a test for CI
Isomo was created by a team of data
scientists, analyst and game-changers driven by the goal of improving the **fairness**,
**efficiency** and **accuracy** of the hiring decisions we make.
We have conducted extensive research showing that **hiring bias** is real and could bring a negative effect to both companies and the individuals in many ways.
By moving beyond traditional approaches and using the
latest research insights, Isomo have the vision to
**simplify and streamline recruitment**. As a result, a **better company culture and performace** can be achieved.
